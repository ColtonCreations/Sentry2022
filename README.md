Arduino and Kinect project
Works with Arduino Uno (or similar) and Kinect for Xbox 360. Uses Processing 2. The drivers and middleware must be installed correctly, I have had success only on Windows 7 and 8, not 10 or 11. Requires Java. HIGHLY recommended to CAREFULLY follow guides online on how to install the Kinect stuff on your PC, I won't be providing that. All this is provided free as in gratis, open source and all the usual no warranties expected or implied, yada yada. Just a dad trying to make cool interactive props for the neighborhood kids on Hallowe'en. Gifs and Wavs sampled from various sources using a fair use type model. Go ahead and sue me if you think the short audio clip from a 10-year old video game is somehow costing you money. I say it might inspire some kid to see this prop in action, buy a copy of the old game it borrowed a clip from and (hopefully) if nothing else inspire some kid to start tinkering, building and learning about electronics, microcontrollers, game design and coding. That's 100% of what i get out of this; it costs me money to build these things, I make not one cent off it. My haunt every year is also 100% free and I do my best to make sure it's also 100% accessible to neurodivergent kids or kids with different levels of mobility/limb differences. Can your game say that?
