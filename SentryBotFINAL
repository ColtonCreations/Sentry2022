Oops. I will try to make this easier to follow, just added stuff to the old stuff and that will be confusing. First time on Github for me really. See notes and changes in other places, sorry you'll ahve to piec some of this together yourself but it's all there, at least what I can share. Drivers etc, you're on your own, get the environment up and running first before you bother with this stuff.
